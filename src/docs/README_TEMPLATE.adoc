[[intro]]
This library lets you process messages in parallel via a single Kafka Consumer meaning you can increase consumer parallelism without increasing the number of partitions in the topic you intend to process.
For many use cases this improves both throughput and latency by reducing load on your brokers.
It also opens up new use cases like extreme parallelism, external data enrichment, and queuing.

.Consume many messages _concurrently_ with a *single* consumer instance:

== Motivation

=== Why would I need this?

The unit of parallelism in Kafka’s consumers is the partition but sometimes you want to break away from this approach and manage parallelism yourself using threads rather than new instances of a Consumer.
Notable use cases include:

* Where partition counts are difficult to change and you need more parallelism than the current configuration allows.

* You wish to avoid over provisioning partitions in topics due to unknown future requirements.

* You wish to reduce the broker-side resource utilization associated with highly-parallel consumer groups.

* You need queue-like semantics that use message level acknowledgment, for example to process a work queue with short- and long-running tasks.

When reading the below, keep in mind that the unit of concurrency and thus performance, is restricted by the number of partitions (degree of sharding / concurrency).
Currently, you can't adjust the number of partitions in your Kafka topics without jumping through a lot of hoops, or breaking your key ordering.

==== Before

.The slow consumer situation with the raw Apache Kafka Consumer client

==== After

.Example usage of the Parallel Consumer
image::https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/2cb3b7e2-bfdf-4e78-8247-22ec394de965/image.png[align="center"]

=== Background

The core Kafka consumer client gives you a batch of messages to process one at a time.
Processing these in parallel on thread pools is difficult, particularly when considering offset management and strong ordering guarantees.
You also need to manage your consume loop, and commit transactions properly if using Exactly Once semantics.

This wrapper library for the Apache Kafka Java client handles all this for you, you just supply your processing function.

Another common situation where concurrent processing of messages is advantageous, is what is referred to as "competing consumers".
A pattern that is often addressed in traditional messaging systems using a shared queue.
Kafka doesn't provide native queue support and this can result in a slow processing message blocking the messages behind it in the same partition.
If <<ordering-guarantees,log ordering>> isn't a concern this can be an unwelcome bottleneck for users.
The Parallel Consumer provides a solution to this problem.

In addition, the <<http-with-vertx,Vert.x extension>> to this library supplies non-blocking interfaces, allowing higher still levels of concurrency with a further simplified interface.
Also included now is a <<project-reactor,module for>> https://projectreactor.io[Project Reactor.io].

=== FAQ

[qanda]
Why not just run more consumers?::
The typical way to address performance issues in a Kafka system, is to increase the number of consumers reading from a topic.
This is effective in many situations, but falls short in a lot too.

* Primarily: You cannot use more consumers than you have partitions available to read from.
For example, if you have a topic with five partitions, you cannot use a group with more than five consumers to read from it.
* Running more extra consumers has resource implications - each consumer takes up resources on both the client and broker side.
Each consumer adds a lot of overhead in terms of memory, CPU, and network bandwidth.
* Large consumer groups (especially many large groups) can cause a lot of strain on the consumer group coordination system, such as rebalance storms.
* Even with several partitions, you cannot achieve the performance levels obtainable by *per-key* ordered or unordered concurrent processing.
* A single slow or failing message will also still block all messages behind the problematic message, ie. the entire partition.
The process may recover, but the latency of all the messages behind the problematic one will be negatively impacted severely.

Why not run more consumers __within__ your application instance?::
* This is in some respects a slightly easier way of running more consumer instances, and in others a more complicated way.
However, you are still restricted by all the per consumer restrictions as described above.

Why not use the Vert.x library yourself in your processing loop?::
* Vert.x us used in this library to provide a non-blocking IO system in the message processing step.
Using Vert.x without using this library with *ordered* processing requires dealing with the quite complicated, and not straight forward, aspect of handling offset commits with Vert.x asynchronous processing system.
+
*Unordered* processing with Vert.x is somewhat easier, however offset management is still quite complicated, and the Parallel Consumer also provides optimizations for message-level acknowledgment in this case.
This library handles offset commits for both ordered and unordered processing cases.

=== Scenarios

Below are some real world use cases which illustrate concrete situations where the described advantages massively improve performance.

* Slow consumer systems in transactional systems (online vs offline or reporting systems)
** Notification system:
+
*** Notification processing system which sends push notifications to a user to acknowledge a two-factor authentication request on their mobile and authorising a login to a website, requires optimal end-to-end latency for a good user experience.
*** A specific message in this queue uncharacteristically takes a long time to process because the third party system is sometimes unpredictably slow to respond and so holds up the processing for *ALL* other notifications for other users that are in the same partition behind this message.
*** Using key order concurrent processing will allow notifications to proceed while this message either slowly succeeds or times out and retires.
** Slow GPS tracking system (slow HTTP service interfaces that can scale horizontally)
*** GPS tracking messages from 100,000 different field devices pour through at a high rate into an input topic.
*** For each message, the GPS location coordinates is checked to be within allowed ranges using a legacy HTTP services, dictated by business rules behind the service.
*** The service takes 50ms to process each message, however can be scaled out horizontally without restriction.
*** The input topic only has 10 partitions and for various reasons (see above) cannot be changed.
*** With the vanilla consumer, messages on each partition must be consumed one after the other in serial order.
*** The maximum rate of message processing is then:
+
`1 second / 50 ms * 10 partitions = 200 messages per second.`
*** By using this library, the 10 partitions can all be processed in key order.
+
`1 second / 50ms × 100,000 keys = 2,000,000 messages per second`
+
While the HTTP system probably cannot handle 2,000,000 messages per second, more importantly, your system is no longer the bottleneck.

** Slow CPU bound model processing for fraud prediction
*** Consider a system where message data is passed through a fraud prediction model which takes CPU cycles, instead of an external system being slow.
*** We can scale easily the number of CPUs on our virtual machine where the processing is being run, but we choose not to scale the partitions or consumers (see above).
*** By deploying onto machines with far more CPUs available, we can run our prediction model massively parallel, increasing our throughput and reducing our end-to-end response times.
* Spikey load with latency sensitive non-functional requirements
** An upstream system regularly floods our input topic daily at close of business with settlement totals data from retail outlets.
*** Situations like this are common where systems are designed to comfortably handle average day time load, but are not provisioned to handle sudden increases in traffic as they don't happen often enough to justify the increased spending on processing capacity that would otherwise remain idle.
*** Without adjusting the available partitions or running consumers, we can reduce our maximum end-to-end latency and increase throughout to get our global days outlet reports to division managers so action can be taken, before close of business.
** Natural consumer behaviour
*** Consider scenarios where bursts of data flooding input topics are generated by sudden user behaviour such as sales or television events ("Oprah" moments).
*** For example, an evening, prime-time game show on TV where users send in quiz answers on their devices.
The end-to-end latency of the responses to these answers needs to be as low as technically possible, even if the processing step is quick.
*** Instead of a vanilla client where each user response waits in a virtual queue with others to be processed, this library allows every single response to be processed in parallel.
* Legacy partition structure
** Any existing setups where we need higher performance either in throughput or latency where there are not enough partitions for needed concurrency level, the tool can be applied.
* Partition overloaded brokers
** Clusters with under-provisioned hardware and with too many partitions already - where we cannot expand partitions even if we were able to.
** Similar to the above, but from the operations perspective, our system is already over partitioned, perhaps in order to support existing parallel workloads which aren't using the tool (and so need large numbers of partitions).
** We encourage our development teams to migrate to the tool, and then being a process of actually __lowering__ the number of partitions in our partitions in order to reduce operational complexity, improve reliability and perhaps save on infrastructure costs.
* Server side resources are controlled by a different team we can't influence
** The cluster our team is working with is not in our control, we cannot change the partition setup, or perhaps even the consumer layout.
** We can use the tool ourselves to improve our system performance without touching the cluster / topic setup.
* Kafka Streams app that had a slow stage
** We use Kafka Streams for our message processing, but one of it's steps have characteristics of the above and we need better performance.
We can break out as described below into the tool for processing that step, then return to the Kafka Streams context.
* Provisioning extra machines (either virtual machines or real machines) to run multiple clients has a cost, using this library instead avoids the need for extra instances to be deployed in any respect.

== Features List

* Have massively parallel consumption processing without running hundreds or thousands of:
** Kafka consumer clients,
** topic partitions,
+
without operational burden or harming the cluster's performance
* Client side queueing system on top of Apache Kafka consumer
** Efficient individual message acknowledgement system (without local or third party external system state storage) to massively reduce (and usually completely eliminate) message replay upon failure - see <<offset_map>> section for more details
* Solution for the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-of-line_blocking["head of line"] blocking problem where continued failure of a single message, prevents progress for messages behind it in the queue
* Per `key` concurrent processing, per partition and unordered message processing
* Offsets committed correctly, in order, of only processed messages, regardless of concurrency level or retries
* Batch support in all versions of the API to process batches of messages in parallel instead of single messages.
** Particularly useful for when your processing function can work with more than a single record at a time - e.g. sending records to an API which has a batch version like Elasticsearch
* Vert.x and Reactor.io non-blocking library integration
** Non-blocking I/O work management
** Vert.x's WebClient and general Vert.x Future support
** Reactor.io Publisher (Mono/Flux) and Java's CompletableFuture (through `Mono#fromFuture`)
* Exactly Once bulk transaction system
** When using the transactional mode, record processing that happens in parallel and produce records back to kafka get all grouped into a large batch transaction, and the offsets and records are submitted through the transactional producer, giving you Exactly once Semantics for parallel processing.
** For further information, see the <<transaction-system>> section.
* Fair partition traversal
* Zero~ dependencies (`Slf4j` and `Lombok`) for the core module
* Java 8 compatibility
* Throttle control and broker liveliness management
* Clean draining shutdown cycle
* Manual global pause / resume of all partitions, without unsubscribing from topics (useful for implementing a simplistic https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker_design_pattern[circuit breaker])
** Circuit breaker patterns for individual paritions or keys can be done through throwing failure exceptions in the processing function (see https://github.com/confluentinc/parallel-consumer/pull/291[PR #291 Explicit terminal and retriable exceptions] for further refinement)
** Note: Pausing of a partition is also automatic, whenever back pressure has built up on a given partition

== Performance

In the best case, you don't care about ordering at all.In which case, the degree of concurrency achievable is simply set by max thread and concurrency settings, or with the Vert.x extension, the Vert.x Vertical being used - e.g. non-blocking HTTP calls.

For example, instead of having to run 1,000 consumers to process 1,000 messages at the same time, we can process all 1,000 concurrently on a single consumer instance.

More typically though you probably still want the per key ordering grantees that Kafka provides.
For this there is the per key ordering setting.
This will limit the library from processing any message at the same time or out of order, if they have the same key.

Massively reduce message processing latency regardless of partition count for spikey workloads where there is good key distribution.
Eg 100,000 “users” all trigger an action at once.
As long as the processing layer can handle the load horizontally (e.g auto scaling web service), per message latency will be massively decreased, potentially down to the time for processing a single message, if the integration point can handle the concurrency.

For example, if you have a key set of 10,000 unique keys, and you need to call an http endpoint to process each one, you can use the per key order setting, and in the best case the system will process 10,000 at the same time using the non-blocking Vert.x HTTP client library.
The user just has to provide a function to extract from the message the HTTP call parameters and construct the HTTP request object.

=== Illustrative Performance Example

.(see link:./parallel-consumer-core/src/test-integration/java/io/confluent/parallelconsumer/integrationTests/VolumeTests.java[VolumeTests.java])
These performance comparison results below, even though are based on real performance measurement results, are for illustrative purposes.
To see how the performance of the tool is related to instance counts, partition counts, key distribution and how it would relate to the vanilla client.
Actual results will vary wildly depending upon the setup being deployed into.

For example, if you have hundreds of thousands of keys in your topic, randomly distributed, even with hundreds of partitions, with only a handful of this wrapper deployed, you will probably see many orders of magnitude performance improvements - massively out performing dozens of vanilla Kafka consumer clients.

.Time taken to process a large number of messages with a Single Parallel Consumer vs a single Kafka Consumer, for different key space sizes. As the number of unique keys in the data set increases, the key ordered Parallel Consumer performance starts to approach that of the unordered Parallel Consumer. The raw Kafka consumer performance remains unaffected by the key distribution.

.Consumer group size effect on total processing time vs a single Parallel Consumer. As instances are added to the consumer group, it's performance starts to approach that of the single instance Parallel Consumer. Key ordering is faster than partition ordering, with unordered being the fastest.

As an illustrative example of relative performance, given:

* A random processing time between 0 and 5ms
* 10,000 messages to process
* A single partition (simplifies comparison - a topic with 5 partitions is the same as 1 partition with a keyspace of 5)
* Default `ParallelConsumerOptions`
** maxConcurrency = 100
** numberOfThreads = 16

=== Common Preparation

.Setup the client
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{project_root}/parallel-consumer-examples/parallel-consumer-example-core/src/main/java/io/confluent/parallelconsumer/examples/core/CoreApp.java[tag=exampleSetup]
----

<1> Setup your clients as per normal.
A Producer is only required if using the `produce` flows.
<2> Choose your ordering type, `KEY` in this case.
This ensures maximum concurrency, while ensuring messages are processed and committed in `KEY` order, making sure no offset is committed unless all offsets before it in it's partition, are completed also.
<3> The maximum number of concurrent processing operations to be performing at any given time.
Also, because the library coordinates offsets, `enable.auto.commit` must be disabled in your consumer.
<5> Subscribe to your topics

NOTE: Because the library coordinates offsets, `enable.auto.commit` must be disabled.

After this setup, one then has the choice of interfaces:

* `ParallelStreamProcessor`
* `VertxParallelStreamProcessor`
* `JStreamParallelStreamProcessor`
* `JStreamVertxParallelStreamProcessor`

There is another interface: `ParallelConsumer` which is integrated, however there is currently no immediate implementation.
See {issues_link}/12[issue #12], and the `ParallelConsumer` JavaDoc:

=== Core

==== Simple Message Process

This is the only thing you need to do, in order to get massively concurrent processing in your code.

.Usage - print message content out to the console in parallel
[source,java,indent=0]
include::{project_root}/parallel-consumer-examples/parallel-consumer-example-core/src/main/java/io/confluent/parallelconsumer/examples/core/CoreApp.java[tag=example]

See the link:./parallel-consumer-examples/parallel-consumer-example-core/src/main/java/io/confluent/parallelconsumer/examples/core/CoreApp.java[core example] project, and it's test.

==== Process and Produce a Response Message

This interface allows you to process your message, then publish back to the broker zero, one or more result messages.
You can also optionally provide a callback function to be run after the message(s) is(are) successfully published to the broker.

.Usage - print message content out to the console in parallel
[source,java,indent=0]
include::{project_root}/parallel-consumer-examples/parallel-consumer-example-core/src/main/java/io/confluent/parallelconsumer/examples/core/CoreApp.java[tag=exampleProduce]

==== Callbacks vs Streams

You have the option to either use callbacks to be notified of events, or use the `Streaming` versions of the API, which use the `java.util.stream.Stream` system:

* `JStreamParallelStreamProcessor`
* `JStreamVertxParallelStreamProcessor`

In future versions, we plan to look at supporting other streaming systems like https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava] via modules.

[[batching]]
=== Batching

The library also supports sending a batch or records as input to the users processing function in parallel.
Using this, you can process several records in your function at once.

To use it, set a `batch size` in the options class.

There are then various access methods for the batch of records - see the `PollContext` object for more information.

IMPORTANT: If an exception is thrown while processing the batch, all messages in the batch will be returned to the queue, to be retried with the standard retry system.
There is no guarantee that the messages will be retried again in the same batch.

----
include::{project_root}/parallel-consumer-examples/parallel-consumer-example-core/src/main/java/io/confluent/parallelconsumer/examples/core/CoreApp.java[tag=batching]
----

<1> Choose your batch size.

==== Restrictions

- If using a batch version of the API, you must choose a batch size in the options class.
- If a batch size is chosen, the "normal" APIs cannot be used, and an error will be thrown.

[[http-with-vertx]]
=== HTTP with the Vert.x Module

----
include::{project_root}/parallel-consumer-examples/parallel-consumer-example-vertx/src/main/java/io/confluent/parallelconsumer/examples/vertx/VertxApp.java[tag=example]
----

<1> Simply return an object representing the request, the Vert.x HTTP engine will handle the rest, using it's non-blocking engine

See the link:{project_root}/parallel-consumer-examples/parallel-consumer-example-vertx/src/main/java/io/confluent/parallelconsumer/examples/vertx/VertxApp.java[Vert.x example] project, and it's test.

[[project-reactor]]
=== Project Reactor

As per the Vert.x support, there is also a Reactor module.
This means you can use Reactor's non-blocking threading model to process your messages, allowing for orders of magnitudes higher concurrent processing than the core module's thread per worker module.

See the link:{project_root}/parallel-consumer-examples/parallel-consumer-example-reactor/src/main/java/io/confluent/parallelconsumer/examples/reactor/ReactorApp.java[Reactor example] project, and it's test.

.Call any Reactor API for each message usage. This example uses a simple `Mono.just` to return a value, but you can use any Reactor API here.

.. Sign up for https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree/[Confluent Cloud], a fully-managed Apache Kafka service.
.. After you log in to Confluent Cloud, click on `Add cloud environment` and name the environment `learn-kafka`.
Using a new environment keeps your learning resources separate from your other Confluent Cloud resources.
.. Click on https://confluent.cloud/learn[LEARN] and follow the instructions to launch a Kafka cluster and to enable Schema Registry.
. Access the client configuration settings
.. From the Confluent Cloud Console, navigate to your Kafka cluster.
From the `Clients` view, get the connection information customized to your cluster (select `Java`).
.. Create new credentials for your Kafka cluster, and then Confluent Cloud will show a configuration block with your new credentials automatically populated (make sure `show API keys` is checked).
.. Use these settings presented to https://docs.confluent.io/clients-kafka-java/current/overview.html[configure your clients].
. Use these clients for steps outlined in the <<common_preparation>> section.

[[upgrading]]
== Upgrading

=== From 0.4 to 0.5

This version has a breaking change in the API - instead of passing in `ConsumerRecord` instances, it passes in a `PollContext` object which has extra information and utility methods.
See the `PollContext` class for more information.

[[ordering-guarantees]]
== Ordering Guarantees

The user has the option to either choose ordered, or unordered message processing.

Either in `ordered` or `unordered` processing, the system will only commit offsets for messages which have been successfully processed.

CAUTION: `Unordered` processing could cause problems for third party integration where ordering by key is required.

CAUTION: Beware of third party systems which are not idempotent, or are key order sensitive.

IMPORTANT: The below diagrams represent a single iteration of the system and a very small number of input partitions and messages.

=== Vanilla Kafka Consumer Operation

Given this input topic with three partitions and a series of messages:

.Input topic
image::https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/37d13382-3067-4c93-b521-7e43f2295fff/image.png[align="center"]

The normal Kafka client operations in the following manner.
Note that typically offset commits are not performed after processing a single message, but is illustrated in this manner for comparison to the single pass concurrent methods below.
Usually many messages are committed in a single go, which is much more efficient, but for our illustrative purposes is not really relevant, as we are demonstration sequential vs concurrent _processing_ messages.

.Normal execution of the raw Kafka client
image::https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/0365890d-e8ff-4a06-b24a-8741175dacc3/image.png[align="center"]

=== Unordered

Unordered processing is where there is no restriction on the order of multiple messages processed per partition, allowing for highest level of concurrency.

This is the fastest option.

.Unordered concurrent processing of message
image::https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/aab5d743-de05-46d0-8c1e-0646d7d2946f/image.png[align="center"]

=== Ordered by Partition

At most only one message from any given input partition will be in flight at any given time.
This means that concurrent processing is restricted to the number of input partitions.

The advantage of ordered processing mode, is that for an assignment of 1000 partitions to a single consumer, you do not need to run 1000 consumer instances or threads, to process the partitions in parallel.

Note that for a given partition, a slow processing message _will_ prevent messages behind it from being processed.
However, messages in other partitions assigned to the consumer _will_ continue processing.

This option is most like normal operation, except if the consumer is assigned more than one partition, it is free to process all partitions in parallel.

.Partition ordered concurrent processing of messages
image::https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/30ad8632-e8fe-4e05-8afd-a2b6b3bab309/image.png[align="center"]

=== Ordered by Key

Most similar to ordered by partition, this mode ensures process ordering by *key* (per partition).

The advantage of this mode, is that a given input topic may not have many partitions, it may have a ~large number of unique keys.
Each of these key -> message sets can actually be processed concurrently, bringing concurrent processing to a per key level, without having to increase the number of input partitions, whilst keeping strong ordering by key.

As usual, the offset tracking will be correct, regardless of the ordering of unique keys on the partition or adjacency to the committed offset, such that after failure or rebalance, the system will not replay messages already marked as successful.

This option provides the performance of maximum concurrency, while maintaining message processing order per key, which is sufficient for many applications.

=== Retries and Ordering

Even during retries, offsets will always be committed only after successful processing, and in order.

== Retries

If processing of a record fails, the record will be placed back into it's queue and retried with a configurable delay (see the `ParallelConsumerOptions` class).
Ordering guarantees will always be adhered to, regardless of failure.

A failure is denoted by *any* exception being thrown from the user's processing function.
The system catches these exceptions, logs them and replaces the record in the queue for processing later.
All types of Exceptions thrown are considered retriable.
To not retry a record, do not throw an exception from your processing function.

TIP:: To avoid the system logging an error, throw an exception which extends PCRetriableException.

TIP:: If there was an error processing a record, and you'd like to skip it - do not throw an exception, and the system will mark the record as succeeded.

If for some reason you want to proactively fail a record, without relying on some other system throwing an exception which you don't catch - simply throw an exception of your own design, which the system will treat the same way.

To configure the retry delay, see `ParallelConsumerOptions#defaultRetryDelay`.

At the moment there is no terminal error support, so messages will continue to be retried forever as long as an exception continues to be thrown from the user function (see <<skipping-records>>).
But still this will not hold up the queues in `KEY` or `UNORDERED` modes, however in `PARTITION` mode it *will* block progress.
Offsets will also continue to be committed (see <<commit-mode>> and <<Offset Map>>).

=== Retry Delay Function

As part of the https://github.com/confluentinc/parallel-consumer/issues/65[enhanced retry epic], the ability to https://github.com/confluentinc/parallel-consumer/issues/82[dynamically determine the retry delay] was added.
This can be used to customise retry delay for a record, such as exponential back off or have different delays for different types of records, or have the delay determined by the status of a system etc.

You can access the retry count of a record through it's wrapped `WorkContainer` class, which is the input variable to the retry delay function.

----

[[skipping-records]]
=== Skipping Records

If for whatever reason you want to skip a record, simply do not throw an exception, or catch any exception being thrown, log and swallow it and return from the user function normally.
The system will treat this as a record processing success, mark the record as completed and move on as though it was a normal operation.

A user may choose to skip a record for example, if it has been retried too many times or if the record is invalid or doesn't need processing.

Implementing a https://github.com/confluentinc/parallel-consumer/issues/196[max retries feature] as a part of the system is planned.

.Example of skipping a record after a maximum number of retries is reached

----
include::{project_root}/parallel-consumer-examples/parallel-consumer-example-core/src/main/java/io/confluent/parallelconsumer/examples/core/CoreApp.java[tag=maxRetries]
----

=== Circuit Breaker Pattern

Although the system doesn't have an https://github.com/confluentinc/parallel-consumer/issues/110[explicit circuit breaker pattern feature], one can be created by combining the custom retry delay function and proactive failure.
For example, the retry delay can be calculated based upon the status of an external system - i.e. if the external system is currently out of action, use a higher retry.
Then in the processing function, again check the status of the external system first, and if it's still offline, throw an exception proactively without attempting to process the message.
This will put the message back in the queue.

.Example of circuit break implementation
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{project_root}/parallel-consumer-examples/parallel-consumer-example-core/src/main/java/io/confluent/parallelconsumer/examples/core/CoreApp.java[tag=circuitBreaker]
----

=== Head of Line Blocking

In order to have a failing record not block progress of a partition, one of the ordering modes other than `PARTITION` must be used, so that the system is allowed to process other messages that are perhaps in `KEY` order or in the case of `UNORDERED` processing - any message.
This is because in `PARTITION` ordering mode, records are always processed in order of partition, and so the Head of Line blocking feature is effectively disabled.

=== Future Work

Improvements to this system are planned, see the following issues:

* https://github.com/confluentinc/parallel-consumer/issues/65[Enhanced retry epic #65]
* https://github.com/confluentinc/parallel-consumer/issues/48[Support scheduled message processing (scheduled retry)]
* https://github.com/confluentinc/parallel-consumer/issues/196[Provide option for max retires, and a call back when reached (potential DLQ) #196]
* https://github.com/confluentinc/parallel-consumer/issues/34[Monitor for progress and optionally shutdown (leave consumer group), skip message or send to DLQ #34]

== Result Models

* Void

Processing is complete simply when your provided function finishes, and the offsets are committed.

* Streaming User Results

When your function is actually run, a result object will be streamed back to your client code, with information about the operation completion.

* Streaming Message Publishing Results

After your operation completes, you can also choose to publish a result message back to Kafka.
The message publishing metadata can be streamed back to your client code.

[[commit-mode]]
== Commit Mode

The system gives you three choices for how to do offset commits.
The simplest of the three are the two Consumer commits modes.
They are of course, `synchronous` and `asynchronous` mode.
The `transactional` mode is explained in the next section.

`Asynchronous` mode is faster, as it doesn't block the control loop.

`Synchronous` will block the processing loop until a successful commit response is received, however, `Asynchronous` will still be capped by the max processing settings in the `ParallelConsumerOptions` class.

If you're used to using the auto commit mode in the normal Kafka consumer, you can think of the `Asynchronous` mode being similar to this.
We suggest starting with this mode, and it is the default.

[[transaction-system]]
=== Apache Kafka EoS Transaction Model in BULK

There is also the option to use Kafka's Exactly Once Semantics (EoS) system.
This causes all messages produced, by all workers in parallel, as a result of processing their messages, to be committed within a SINGLE, BULK transaction, along with their source offset.

Note importantly - this is a BULK transaction, not a per input record transaction.

This means that even under failure, the results will exist exactly once in the Kafka output topic.
If as a part of your processing, you create side effects in other systems, this pertains to the usual idempotency requirements when breaking of EoS Kafka boundaries.

CAUTION:: This is a BULK transaction, not a per input record transaction.
There is not a single transaction per input record and per worker "thread", but one *LARGE* transaction that gets used by all parallel processing, until the commit interval.

NOTE:: As with the `synchronous` processing mode, this will also block the processing loop until a successful transaction completes

CAUTION: This cannot be true for any externally integrated third party system, unless that system is __idempotent__.

For implementations details, see the <<Transactional System Architecture>> section.

[[streams-usage]]
== Using with Kafka Streams

Kafka Streams (KS) doesn't yet (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-311%3A+Async+processing+with+dynamic+scheduling+in+Kafka+Streams[KIP-311],
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-408%3A+Add+Asynchronous+Processing+To+Kafka+Streams[KIP-408]) have parallel processing of messages.
However, any given preprocessing can be done in KS, preparing the messages.
One can then use this library to consume from an input topic, produced by KS to process the messages in parallel.

For a code example, see the <<streams-usage-code>> section.

==== Integration Testing with TestContainers
//https://github.com/confluentinc/schroedinger#integration-testing-with-testcontainers

We use the excellent https://testcontainers.org[Testcontainers] library for integration testing with JUnit.

To speed up test execution, you can enable container reuse across test runs by setting the following in your https://www.testcontainers.org/features/configuration/[`~/.testcontainers.properties` file]:

[source]
----
testcontainers.reuse.enable=true
----

This will leave the container running after the JUnit test is complete for reuse by subsequent runs.

> NOTE: The container will only be left running if it is not explicitly stopped by the JUnit rule.
> For this reason, we use a variant of the https://www.testcontainers.org/test_framework_integration/manual_lifecycle_control/#singleton-containers[singleton container pattern]
> instead of the JUnit rule.

Testcontainers detects if a container is reusable by hashing the container creation parameters from the JUnit test.
If an existing container is _not_ reusable, a new container will be created, **but the old container will not be removed**.

Target | Description --- | ---
`testcontainers-list` | List all containers labeled as testcontainers
`testcontainers-clean` | Remove all containers labeled as testcontainers

.Stop and remove all containers labeled with `org.testcontainers=true`
[source,bash]
----
docker container ls --filter 'label=org.testcontainers=true' --format '{{.ID}}' \
| $(XARGS) docker container rm --force
----

.List all containers labeled with `org.testcontainers=true`
[source,bash]
----

> NOTE: `testcontainers-clean` removes **all** docker containers on your system with the `io.testcontainers=true` label > (including the most recent container which may be reusable).

See https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/pull/1781[this testcontainers PR] for details on the reusable containers feature.

== Implementation Details

=== Core Architecture

Concurrency is controlled by the size of the thread pool (`worker pool` in the diagram).
Work is performed in a blocking manner, by the users submitted lambda functions.

These are the main sub systems:

- controller thread
- broker poller thread
- work pool thread
- work management
- offset map manipulation

Each thread collaborates with the others through thread safe Java collections.

.Core Architecture. Threads are represented by letters and colours, with their steps in sequential numbers.

=== Vert.x Architecture

The Vert.x module is an optional extension to the core module.
As depicted in the diagram, the architecture extends the core architecture.

Instead of the work thread pool count being the degree of concurrency, it is controlled by a max parallel requests setting, and work is performed asynchronously on the Vert.x engine by a _core_ count aligned Vert.x managed thread pool using Vert.x asynchronous IO plugins (https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#_verticles[verticles]).

=== Transactional System Architecture

image::https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/7480d948-ed7d-4370-a308-8ec12e6b453b/image.png[]

[[offset_map]]
=== Offset Map

Unlike a traditional queue, messages are not deleted on an acknowledgement.
However, offsets *are* tracked *per message*, per consumer group - there is no message replay for successful messages, even over clean restarts.

Across a system failure, only completed messages not stored as such in the last offset payload commit will be replayed.
This is not an _exactly once guarantee_, as message replay cannot be prevented across failure.

CAUTION: Note that Kafka's Exactly Once Semantics (EoS) (transactional processing) also does not prevent _duplicate message replay_ - it *presents* an _effectively once_ result messages in Kafka topics.
Messages may _still_ be replayed when using `EoS`.
This is an important consideration when using it, especially when integrating with thrid party systems, which is a very common pattern for utilising this project.

As mentioned previously, offsets are always committed in the correct order and only once all previous messages have been successfully processed; regardless of <<ordering-guarantees,ordering mode>> selected.
We call this the "highest committable offset".

However, because messages can be processed out of order, messages beyond the highest committable offset must also be tracked for success and not replayed upon restart of failure.
To achieve this the system goes a step further than normal Kafka offset commits.

When messages beyond the highest committable offset are successfully processed;

. they are stored as such in an internal memory map.
. when the system then next commits offsets
. if there are any messages beyond the highest offset which have been marked as succeeded
.. the offset map is serialised and encoded into a base 64 string, and added to the commit message metadata.
. upon restore, if needed, the system then deserializes this offset map and loads it back into memory
. when each messages is polled into the system
.. it checks if it's already been previously completed
.. at which point it is then skipped.

This ensures that no message is reprocessed if it's been previously completed.

IMPORTANT: Successful messages beyond the _highest committable offset_ are still recorded as such in a specially constructed metadata payload stored alongside the Kafka committed offset.
These messages are not replayed upon restore/restart.

The offset map is compressed in parallel using two different compression techniques - run length encoding and bitmap encoding.
The sizes of the compressed maps are then compared, and the smallest chosen for serialization.
If both serialised formats are significantly large, they are then both compressed using `zstd` compression, and if that results in a smaller serialization then the compressed form is used instead.


==== Storage Notes

* Runtime data model creates list of incomplete offsets
* Continuously builds a full complete / not complete bit map from the base offset to be committed
* Dynamically switching storage
** encodes into a `BitSet`, and a `RunLength`, then compresses both using zstd, then uses the smallest and tags as such in the encoded String
** Which is smallest can depend on the size and information density of the offset map
*** Smaller maps fit better into uncompressed `BitSets` ~(30 entry map bitset: compressed: 13 Bytes, uncompressed: 4 Bytes)
*** Larger maps with continuous sections usually better in compressed `RunLength`
*** Completely random offset maps, compressed and uncompressed `BitSet` is roughly the same (2000 entries, uncompressed bitset: 250, compressed: 259, compressed bytes array: 477)
*** Very large maps (20,000 entries), a compressed `BitSet` seems to be significantly smaller again if random.
* Gets stored along with base offset for each partition, in the offset `commitsync` `metadata` string
* The offset commit metadata has a hardcoded limit of 4096 bytes (4 kb) per partition (@see `kafka.coordinator.group.OffsetConfig#DefaultMaxMetadataSize = 4096`)
** Because of this, if our map doesn't fit into this, we have to drop it and not use it, losing the shorter replay benefits.
However, with runlength encoding and typical offset patterns this should be quite rare.
*** Work is being done on continuous and predictive space requirements, which will optionally prevent the system from continuing past a point by introducing local backpressure which it can't proceed without dropping the encoded map information - see https://github.com/confluentinc/parallel-consumer/issues/53[Exact continuous offset encoding for precise offset payload size back pressure].
** Not being able to fit the map into the metadata, depends on message acknowledgement patterns in the use case and the numbers of messages involved.
Also, the information density in the map (i.e. a single not yet completed message in 4000 completed ones will be a tiny map and will fit very large amounts of messages)

===== FAQ

[qanda]
If for example, offset 5 cannot be processed for whatever reason, does it cause the committed offset to stick to 5?::
Yes - the committed offset would "stick" to 5, with the metadata payload containing all the per msg ack's beyond 5.
+
(Reference: https://github.com/confluentinc/parallel-consumer/issues/415#issuecomment-1256022394[#415])

In the above scenario, would the system eventually exceed the OffsetMap size limit?::
No, as if the payload size hits 75% or more of the limit (4kB), the back pressure system kicks in, and no more records will be taken for processing, until it drops below 75% again.
Instead, it will keep retrying existing records.
+
However, note that if the only record to continually fail is 5, and all others succeed, let's say offset 6-50,000, then the metadata payload is only ~2 shorts (1 and (50,000-6=) 49,994), as it will use run length encoding.
So it's very efficient.
