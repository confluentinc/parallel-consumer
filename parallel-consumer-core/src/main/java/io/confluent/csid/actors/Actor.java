/**
 * <h1>Micro Actor framework for structured, ordered, simple IPC</h1>
 * <p>
 * By sending messages as Java Lambda (closure) functions, the Actor paradigm messages are effectively generated for us
 * automatically by the compiler. This takes the hassle out of creating message classes for every type of message we
 * want to send an actor - by effectively defining the message fields from the variables of the scope being closed over
 * and captured.
 * <h2>Sending</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link ActorImpl} works in two parts - sending messages and processing them. Messages can be sent in two ways, by
 * {@link #ask}ing, or {@link #tell}ing.
 * <h3>Telling</h3>
 * <p>
 * The closure message is sent into the queue, with no response.
 * <h3>Asking</h3>
 * <p>
 * The closure message is sent into the queue, and a {@link Future} returned which will contain the response once it's
 * processed.
 * <p>
 * Messages can also be sent to the front of the queue, by using the {@code Immediately} versions of the methods. Note:
 * messages sent with these versions end up effectively in a "First In, Last Out" (FILO) queue, as a subsequent
 * immediate message will be in front of previous ones.
 * <h2>Processing</h2>
 * <p>
 * To process the closures, you must call one of the processing methods, and execution will be done in the calling
 * thread.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #process()} function iterates over all the closures in the queue, executing them serially.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #processBlocking(Duration)} version does the same initially, but then also will block by
 * {@link BlockingQueue#poll(long, TimeUnit)}ing the queue for new messages for the given duration, in order to allow
 * your program's thread to effectively {@link Thread#sleep} until new messages are sent.
 * <h2>Naming</h2>
 * Naming suggestions for classes declaring APIs which use the {@link ActorImpl}:
 * <p>
 * {@code Sync} denotes methods which will block using the {@link #ask} functions, waiting for a response.
 * <p>
 * {@code Async} denotes methods which will return immediately, after queueing a message.
 * <p>
