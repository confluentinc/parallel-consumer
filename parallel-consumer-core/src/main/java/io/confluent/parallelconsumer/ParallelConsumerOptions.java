         * Messages sent in parallel by different workers get added to the same transaction block - you end up with
         * transactions 100ms (by default) "large", containing all records sent during that time period, from the
         * offsets being committed.
         * <p>
         * Of no use, if not also producing messages (i.e. using a {@link ParallelStreamProcessor#pollAndProduce}
         * variation).
         * <p>
         * Note: Records being sent by different threads will all be in a single transaction, as PC shares a single
         * Producer instance. This could be seen as a performance overhead advantage, efficient resource use, in
         * exchange for a loss in transaction granularity.
         * <p>
         * The benefits of using this mode are:
         * <p>
         * a) All records produced from a given source offset will either all be visible, or none will be
         * ({@link org.apache.kafka.common.IsolationLevel#READ_COMMITTED}).
         * <p>
         * b) If any records making up a transaction have a terminal issue being produced, or the system crashes before
         * finishing sending all the records and committing, none will ever be visible and the system will eventually
         * retry them in new transactions - potentially with different combinations of records from the original.
         * <p>
         * c) A source offset, and it's produced records will be committed as an atomic set. Normally: either the record
         * producing could fail, or the committing of the source offset could fail, as they are separate individual
         * operations. When using Transactions, they are committed together - so if either operations fails, the
         * transaction will never get committed, and upon recovery, the system will retry the set again (and no
         * duplicates will be visible in the topic).
         * <p>
         * This {@code CommitMode} is the slowest of the options, but there will be no duplicates in Kafka caused by
         * producing a record multiple times if previous offset commits have failed or crashes have occurred (however
         * message replay may cause duplicates in external systems which is unavoidable - external systems must be
         * idempotent).
         * <p>
         * The default commit interval {@link AbstractParallelEoSStreamProcessor#KAFKA_DEFAULT_AUTO_COMMIT_FREQUENCY}
         * gets automatically reduced from the default of 5 seconds to 100ms (the same as Kafka Streams <a
         * href=https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/streams/developer-guide/config-streams.html">commit.interval.ms</a>).
         * Reducing this configuration places higher load on the broker, but will reduce (but cannot eliminate) replay
         * upon failure. Note also that when using transactions in Kafka, consumption in {@code READ_COMMITTED} mode is
         * blocked up to the offset of the first STILL open transaction. Using a smaller commit frequency reduces this
         * minimum consumption latency - the faster transactions are closed, the faster the transaction content can be
         * read by {@code READ_COMMITTED} consumers. More information about this can be found on the Confluent blog
         * post:
         * <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/enabling-exactly-once-kafka-streams/">Enabling Exactly-Once in Kafka
         * Streams</a>.
         * <p>
         * When producing multiple records (see {@link ParallelStreamProcessor#pollAndProduceMany}), all records must
         * have been produced successfully to the broker before the transaction will commit, after which all will be
         * visible together, or none.
         * <p>
         * Records produced while running in this mode, won't be seen by consumer running in
         * {@link ConsumerConfig#ISOLATION_LEVEL_CONFIG} {@link org.apache.kafka.common.IsolationLevel#READ_COMMITTED}
         * mode until the transaction is complete and all records are produced successfully. Records produced into a
         * transaction that gets aborted or timed out, will never be visible.
         * <p>
         * The system must prevent records from being produced to the brokers whose source consumer record offsets has
         * not been included in this transaction. Otherwise, the transactions would include produced records from
         * consumer offsets which would only be committed in the NEXT transaction, which would break the EoS guarantees.
         * To achieve this, first work processing and record producing is suspended (by acquiring the commit lock -
         * see{@link #commitLockAcquisitionTimeout}, as record processing requires the produce lock), then succeeded
         * consumer offsets are gathered, transaction commit is made, then when the transaction has finished, processing
         * resumes by releasing the commit lock. This periodically slows down record production during this phase, by
         * the time needed to commit the transaction.
         * <p>
         * This is all separate from using an IDEMPOTENT Producer, which can be used, along with the
         * {@link ParallelConsumerOptions#commitMode} {@link CommitMode#PERIODIC_CONSUMER_SYNC} or
         * {@link CommitMode#PERIODIC_CONSUMER_ASYNCHRONOUS}.
         * <p>
         * Failure:
         * <p>
         * Commit lock: If the system cannot acquire the commit lock in time, it will shut down for whatever reason, the
         * system will shut down (fail fast) - during the shutdown a final commit attempt will be made. The default
         * timeout for acquisition is very high though - see {@link #commitLockAcquisitionTimeout}. This can be caused
         * by the user processing function taking too long to complete.
         * <p>
         * Produce lock: If the system cannot acquire the produce lock in time, it will fail the record processing and
         * retry the record later. This can be caused by the controller taking too long to commit for some reason. See
         * {@link #produceLockAcquisitionTimeout}. If using {@link #allowEagerProcessingDuringTransactionCommit}, this
         * may cause side effect replay when the record is retried, otherwise there is no replay. See
