     * Offsets beyond the highest committable offset (see {@link #getOffsetHighestSequentialSucceeded()}) which haven't

     * <p>
     * <p>
     * <h2>How does this handle gaps in the offsets in the source partitions?:</h2>
     * <p>
     * We track per record acknowledgement, by only storing the offsets of records <em>OF WHICH WE'VE RECEIVED</em>
     * through {@link KafkaConsumer#poll} calls.
     * <p>
     * This is as explicitly opposed to looking at the lowest offset we've polled, and synthetically creating a list of
     * EXPECTED offsets from the range from it to the highest polled. If we were to construct this offset range
     * synthetically like this, then we would need to expect to process/receive records which might not exist, for
     * whatever reason, usually due to compaction.
     * <p>
     * Instead, the offsets tracked are only determined from the records we've given to process from the broker - we
     * make no assumptions about which offsets exist. This way we don't have to worry about gaps in the offsets. Also, a
     * nice outcome of this is that a gap in the offsets is effectively the same as, as far as we're concerned, an
     * offset which has succeeded - because either way we have no action to take.
     * <p>
     * This is independent of the actual queued {@link WorkContainer}s. This is because to start with, data about
     * incomplete offsets come from the encoded metadata payload that gets committed along with the highest committable
     * offset ({@link #getOffsetHighestSequentialSucceeded()}) and so we don't yet have ConsumerRecord's for those
     * offsets until we start polling for them. And so they are not always in sync.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * <h2>Concurrency:</h2>
     * <p>
     * Needs to be concurrent because, the committer requesting the data to commit may be another thread - the broker
     * polling sub system - {@link BrokerPollSystem#maybeDoCommit}. The alternative to having this as a concurrent
     * collection, would be to have the control thread prepare possible commit data on every cycle, and park that data
     * so that the broker polling thread can grab it, if it wants to commit - i.e. the poller would not prepare/query
     * the data for itself. This requirement is removed in the upcoming PR #200 Refactor: Consider a shared nothing
     * architecture.
     *
     * @see io.confluent.parallelconsumer.offsets.BitSetEncoder for disucssion on how this is impacts per record ack
