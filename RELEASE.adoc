= Releasing

- Update the changelog and commit
- Run the maven release:prepare goal:

`release:prepare -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -DpushChanges=false -Darguments=-DskipTests -Pci`

- Push the plugin's commits one at a time (otherwise need to request Jenkins to build the release tag - so this is a minor shortcut)
- Wait for Jenkins to finish running the build (~15 minutes)
- Wait for Sonatype to publish from it's staging area (~15 minutes)
- Create the release on GH from the tag
- Paste in the details from the changelog, save, share as discussion
- Announce on slack(s), mailing list,
