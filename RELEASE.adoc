= Releasing

- Update the changelog and commit
- Run the maven release:prepare goal:

`release:prepare -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -DpushChanges=false -Darguments=-DskipTests -Pci`

- Push the plugin's commits one at a time (otherwise need to request Jenkins to build the release tag - so this is a minor shortcut)
- Wait for Jenkins to finish running the build (~15 minutes)
- Wait for Sonatype to publish from it's staging area (~15 minutes) https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/confluent/parallelconsumer/parallel-consumer-parent/[repo1 link]
- Verify the release is available on Maven Central https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/confluent/parallelconsumer/parallel-consumer-parent/[repo1 link]
- Create the release on GH from the tag
- Paste in the details from the changelog, save, share as discussion
- Announce on slack (community #clients and internal channels), mailing list, twitter
